# Phonetic-Changer
Program that takes in a file with phonetic transcriptions, applies systematic sound changes from a change list file, and writes the changed transcriptions to new files

This program is part of a series of programs I have been working on for a language construction component of a worldbuilding project I have been doing for the past several years. This specific program was created first locally and then uploaded to Github over the course of about a week. The current version reads an ordered changelist in SPE-style notation and applies them to a file formatted into three "tiers" of bullet points communicating word information. Current shortcomings include no support for SPE brackets, C and V comprehension, and feature comprehension. The program also does not touch any transcription that is not already in the form of brackets, spaces, and commas as seen in the samples. This is because a separate program is needed which interprets phonetic transcription according to an orthographic standard and edits the files as such.
